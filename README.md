# SpooderInstallerSharp
 The new Spooder Installer written in C# and Avalonia.
 Note: This app is currently in development and not ready to use in production.

 ## Node.js and Git Included
 The main reason the installer is being rewritten in C# is because it doesn't need everything that's included in the Electron app. While there may have been some way to use the Node.js packaged with Electron, I found it easier to package Node to C#.

## Frontend Powered by Avalonia UI
 Avalonia will allow deployment to desktop and mobile platforms. I'm not entirely sure if Spooder can run on Android, but it would be cool to bring your bot on the go.

## Current features
 Currently only the desktop app can install, run, and stop Spooder.
